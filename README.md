# Snusr
This Android application was made as part of the final Android programming course exam while attending Høgskolen i Sørøst-Norge, 2016. It's main purpose was to demonstrate proficiency in several disciplines, including threading, bluetooth connectivity, material design and usage of fragments. 

The app itself is an information app to enable users to keep track of their favourite snus brands. Functionality includes selecting favourites from a list of products, adding a new product (with photo either from the web or taken with the device's camera) as well as sharing that list via bluetooth.
